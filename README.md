# devEco Community Requests & Feedback

Welcome to the **devEco Community Request Tracker**  
This repository is where community members can submit suggestions, feedback, ideas, and requests related to our platforms (Discord, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc).  

We use **GitHub Issues** to organize and track community input so nothing gets lost and everyone can follow along.

## What Can You Submit?
You can open an issue for:
- Feature requests (e.g., new Discord channel, video idea, LinkedIn post theme)
- Bug reports (e.g., broken links, errors, incorrect info)
- Suggestions for improvement (e.g., content style, moderation approach)
- General feedback (e.g., how we can better serve the community)
